I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Department of Political Science and the Computational Social Sciences Program at UC San Diego. I use computational social sciences tools, with a regional focus in Latin America, to investigate how to improve public goods provision in developing democracies. My research combines statistical modeling, experiments, elite and popular surveys, and other social sciences methods. My papers have contributed to understanding the nexus between legislature size and welfare, the failures in bottom-up accountability, the effects of elite capturing, and the elite preferences toward climate change mitigation agreements. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Experimental Political Science*, *Research and Politics*, and *Global Environmental Politics*.
